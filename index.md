The inaugural Meep user and developer conference (MeepCon) will be held from July 27-29, 2022 in a hybrid onsite/virtual format hosted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, MA. The focus of this year's conference is *applications and advances in electromagnetic modeling using Meep*. The three-day event consists of tutorials (July 27), technical talks (July 28), and a developer meeting (July 29). The conference is free of charge and open to the public via a live online broadcast. Registration is required (in-person capacity may be limited). All sessions will be recorded and archived.
